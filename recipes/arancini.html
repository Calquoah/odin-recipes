<h4>This deepfried delicacy of Sicily is packed with rice, meat, tomato sauce, and caciocavallo cheese</h4>
    <p>Arancini are enjoyed all over Sicily, and while most are
        prepared with rice, meat, sauce, and cheese there are some areas that
        add their own flavors such as pistacchio to this breaded delight.
    </p>
    <p>Like other Italian dishes, these can be enjoyed as a snack or made into a full meal.
        The preparation is a little on the longer side, but overall not so complicated.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Intermediate</p>
    <p><strong>Prep Time</strong>: 1-2 hours</p>
