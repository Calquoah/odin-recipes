<h4>This deepfried delicacy of Sicily is packed with rice, meat, tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheese</h4>
    <p>Arancini are enjoyed all over Sicily, and while most arancini are
        prepared with rice, meat, sauce, and cheese there are some areas that
        add their own flavors such as pistacchio.
    </p>
    <p>Like other Italian dishes, these can be enjoyed as a snack or made into a full meal.
        The preparation is a little on the longer side, but overall not so complicated.
