<h3>Hearty pasta prepared with eggplants in a tomato sauce</h3>
    <p>Originally from Roma, this simple, yet <em>flavourful</em> dish is a mainstay with the locals. It's central pull is its 
ability to be crafted to individual preferences due to its simplicity.</p>
    <p>While many prefer the richness of Rigatoni Carbonara or the basic, but
        delightful, Bucatini Amatriciana, Pasta alla Norma has its own dedicated 
        following.
